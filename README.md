## Troubleshooting:

Try to disable other userscripts and refresh the website, if it the script works you can try turning them on again, if not please submit an Issue so I can try to make the compatible.

I noticed that *E-Hentai  Highlighter* stops the script from working, but after disabling it, refreshing and turning it on again, both work (though the highlights won't work on the new favoriteslists on */favorites.php*)

## Bugs:

- You can not search through unlimited_favorites [I can maybe replicate the search to some degree]
- If a gallery get's updated the new instance will not be favorited
- *Show All Favorites* does not show unlimited_favorites
- Favorites are saved by local time not server time
- Using the options on */favorites.php* to resort your favorites to different lists does not work
- */favorites.php* still looks a bit akward
